# DIFFERENCE-MATRIX-PROJECTION

*This Project is not fully completed, Yet!*


This is a Implementation of Difference Matrix Projection by Me (Arima Valan Immanuel)

I have implemented this Feature Extraction Techniwue for various projects, from Simple Image Classification to Pose Estimation and Gait Analysis, Fundus Image Segmentation, Real-Time Object Detection for Risk Evaluation, etc.

This method was way more amazing.

I will constantly upload my results and the projects where I've Implemented this Technique in following days.

I definitely would've followed some noob/rookie paradigm while coding. Will improve it, and commit the updates in following days.

And I Sincerely wanted to Thank : Xing Liu, Kar-Ann Toh and J. P. Allebech for this wonderful idea. I was inspired at the moment I read theis paper.
